This repo contains the R codes for comparison of Inverse Probability Weight Estimators as described in Datta and Polson (2022). 
The candidates are: the original Horvitz--Thompson, Hajek, the Li's estimator, i.e. the Bayes posterior mean under a Beta hyperprior and Ghosh (2015)'s binning and smoothing idea applied to the Hajek estimator.
